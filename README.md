All scripts are easy to run and were built using python 3 interpreter

2. navigate to the location of the script you wish to run using your terminal
3. type "python script name" without the quotes e.g python guessing.py to run the script

NOTE: some installations might require affixing 3 to the python name, i.e python3 before the script name.
